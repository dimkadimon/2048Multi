# 2048 Multi
A small clone of [2048 by Gabriele Cirulli](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/).

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://dimkadimon.github.io/2048Multi/)

This version of 2048 uses blocks of two colours that need to merged separately. This adds a whole new dimension to the game. Please enjoy and share with your friends!
