# 2048 Revolution
A small clone of [2048 by Gabriele Cirulli](http://gabrielecirulli.github.io/2048/).

Made just for fun. [Play it here!](http://dimkadimon.github.io/2048Revolution/)

This version of 2048 uses walls that cannot be moved. This adds a whole new dimension to the game and provides an endless variety of levels. Please enjoy and share with your friends!

### Contributions
